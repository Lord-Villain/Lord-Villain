        <h1> Lyrics for Faded </h1>

        <p> You were the shadow to my light
            <br> Did you feel us
            <br> Another start
            <br> You fade away
            <br> Afraid our aim is out of sight
            <br> Wanna see us
            <br> Alive
            <br> Where are you now
            <br> Where are you now
            <br> Where are you now
            <br> Was it all in my fantasy
            <br> Where are you now
            <br> Were you only imaginary
            <br> Where are you now
            <br> Atlantis
            <br> Under the sea
            <br> Under the sea
            <br> Where are you now
            <br> Another dream
            <br> The monsters running wild inside of me
            <br> I'm faded
            <br> I'm faded
            <br> So lost
            <br> I'm faded
            <br> I'm faded
            <br> So lost
            <br> I'm faded
            <br> These shallow waters, never met
            <br> What I needed
            <br> I'm letting go
            <br> A deeper dive
            <br> Eternal silence of the sea
            <br> I'm breathing
            <br> Alive
            <br> Where are you now
            <br> Where are you now
            <br> Under the bright
            <br> But faded lights
            <br> You set my heart on fire
            <br> Where are you now
            <br> Where are you now
            <br> Where are you now
            <br> Atlantis
            <br> Under the sea
            <br> Under the sea
            <br> Where are you now
            <br> Another dream
            <br> The monsters running wild inside of me
            <br> I'm faded
            <br> I'm faded
            <br> So lost
            <br> I'm faded
            <br> I'm faded
            <br> So lost
            <br> I'm faded

        <H1> Lyrics for Lily </H1>

        <p> Lily was a little girl
            <br> Afraid of the big, wide world
            <br> She grew up within her castle walls
            <br> Now and then she tried to run
            <br> And then on the night with the setting sun
            <br> She went in the woods away
            <br> So afraid, all alone
            <br> They warned her, don't go there
            <br> There's creatures who are hiding in the dark
            <br> Then something came creeping
            <br> It told her, don't you worry just
            <br> Follow everywhere I go
            <br> Top over the mountains or valley low
            <br> Give you everything you've been dreaming of
            <br> Just let me in, ooh
            <br> Everything you want in gold, I'll be the magic story you've been told
            <br> And you'll be safe under my control
            <br> Just let me in, ooh
            <br> Just let me in, ooh
            <br> She knew she was hypnotized
            <br> And walking on cold thin ice
            <br> Then it broke, and she awoke again
            <br> Then she ran faster than
            <br> Start screaming, "Is there someone out there?"
            <br> Please help me
            <br> Come get me
            <br> Behind her, she can hear it say
            <br> Follow everywhere I go
            <br> Top over the mountains or valley low
            <br> Give you everything you've been dreaming of
            <br> Just let me in, ooh
            <br> Everything you want in gold, I'll be the magic story you've been told
            <br> And you'll be safe under my control
            <br> Just let me in, ooh
            <br> Just let me in, ooh
            <br> Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
            <br> Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
            <br> Everything you want in gold, I'll be the magic story you've been told
            <br> And you'll be safe under my control
            <br> Just let me in, ooh
            <br> Follow everywhere I go
            <br> Top over the mountains or valley low
            <br> Give you everything you've been dreaming of
            <br> Just let me in, ooh
            <br> Then she ran faster than
            <br> Start screaming, "Is there someone out there?"
            <br> Please help me

        <h1> Lyrics for Sorry </h1>

        <p> Confetti is falling
            <br> At five in the morning
            <br> They're screaming and crying
            <br> But I'm all by myself
            <br> I know you, I'm sorry
            <br> I made up a story
            <br> I'm lonely, I'm falling
            <br> Just like you, I'm sorry
            <br> Lo-lo-ha-he-ey-yo-la
            <br> Lo-lo-ho-lo-le-lo-la
            <br> Lo-lo, lo-lo
            <br> Lo-lo-ho-lo-le-lo-la
            <br> Lo-lo-ho-lo-le-lo-la
            <br> Lo-lo-ho-lo-le-lo-la
            <br> Lo-lo-ho-lo-le-lo-la
            <br> Confetti is falling
            <br> At five in the morning
            <br> They're screaming and crying
            <br> But I'm all by myself
            <br> I know you, I'm sorry
            <br> I made up a story
            <br> I'm lonely, I'm falling
            <br> Just like you, I'm sorry

        <h1> Lyrics for Different World </h1>

        <p> All we know
            <br> Left untold
            <br> Beaten by a broken dream
            <br> Nothing like what it used to be
            <br> (Used to be)
            <br> We've been chasing our demons down an empty road
            <br> Been watching our castle turning into dust
            <br> Escaping our shadows just to end up here, once more
            <br> And we both know
            <br> This is not the world we had in mind
            <br> But we got time
            <br> We are stuck on answers we can't find
            <br> But we got time
            <br> And even though we might have lost tonight
            <br> The skyline reminds us of a different time
            <br> This is not the world we had in mind
            <br> But we got time
            <br> Broken smile, tired eyes
            <br> I can feel your longing heart
            <br> Call my name, howling from afar
            <br> We've been fighting our demons just to stay afloat
            <br> Been building a castle just to watch it fall
            <br> Been running forever just to end up here, once more
            <br> And now we know
            <br> This is not the world we had in mind
            <br> But we got time
            <br> We are stuck on answers we can't find
            <br> But we got time
            <br> And even though we might have lost tonight
            <br> The skyline reminds us of a different time
            <br> This is not the world we had in mind
            <br> But we got time
            <br> Take me back
            <br> Back to the mountainside
            <br> Under the Northern Lights
            <br> Chasing the stars
            <br> Take me back
            <br> Back to the mountainside
            <br> When we were full of life
            <br> Back to the start
            <br> And we both know that
            <br> This is not the world we had in mind
            <br> But we got time
            <br> We are stuck on answers we can't find
            <br> But we got time
            <br> And even though we might have lost tonight
            <br> The skyline reminds us of a different time
            <br> This is not the world we had in mind
            <br> But we got time

        <h1> Lyrics of Darkside </h1>

        <p> We're not in love
            <br> We share no stories
            <br> Just something in your eyes
            <br> Don't be afraid
            <br> The shadows know me
            <br> Let's leave the world behind
            <br> Take me through the night
            <br> Fall into the dark side
            <br> We don't need the light
            <br> We'll live on the dark side
            <br> I see it
            <br> Let's feel it
            <br> While we're still young and fearless
            <br> Let go of the light
            <br> Fall into the dark side
            <br> Fall into the dark side
            <br> Give into the dark side
            <br> Let go of the light
            <br> Fall into the dark side
            <br> Beneath the sky
            <br> As black as diamonds
            <br> We're running out of time (Time, time)
            <br> Don't wait for truth
            <br> To come and blind us
            <br> Let's just believe their lies
            <br> Believe it
            <br> I see it
            <br> I know that you can feel it
            <br> No secrets worth keeping
            <br> So fool me like I'm dreaming
            <br> Take me through the night
            <br> Fall into the dark side
            <br> We don't need the light
            <br> We'll live on the dark side
            <br> I see it
            <br> Let's feel it
            <br> While we're still young and fearless
            <br> Let go of the light
            <br> Fall into the dark side
            <br> Fall into the dark side
            <br> Give into the dark side
            <br> Let go of the light
            <br> Fall into the dark side
            <br> Take me through the night
            <br> Fall into the dark side
            <br> We don't need the light
            <br> We'll live on the dark side
            <br> I see it
            <br> Let's feel it
            <br> While we're still young and fearless
            <br> Let go of the light

        <h1> Lyrics of Play </h1>

        <p> We used to hide under the covers
            <br> Serenade each other with careless melodies
            <br> Something buried deep inside us
            <br> The major and the minor, we're like piano keys
            <br> You played for me
            <br> You played for me, oh
            <br> You played for me
            <br> I swear it, even in my sleep
            <br> I hear it like the memory
            <br> Of everything we used to be
            <br> You played for me
            <br> You played for me
            <br> You played for me
            <br> We couldn't stop the world from turning
            <br> It was like a whirlwind, scattered us like leaves
            <br> But I'm stuck inside a feeling, a song that never leaves
            <br> We were like a symphony
            <br> You played for me
            <br> You played for me, oh
            <br> You played for me
            <br> I swear it, even in my sleep
            <br> I hear it like the memory
            <br> Of everything we used to be
            <br> You played for me
            <br> You played for me
            <br> You played for me
            <br> You and me
            <br> You and me
            <br> You and me
            <br> You and me
            <br> You and me
            <br> You and me
            <br> You played for me
            <br> I swear it, even in my sleep
            <br> I hear it like the memory
            <br> Of everything we used to be
            <br> You played for me

        <h1> Lyrics of On My Way </h1>

        <p> I'm sorry but
            <br> Don't wanna talk, I need a moment before I go
            <br> It's nothing personal
            <br> I draw the blinds
            <br> They don't need to see me cry
            <br> 'Cause even if they understand
            <br> They don't understand
            <br> So then when I'm finished
            <br> I'm all 'bout my business and ready to save the world
            <br> I'm taking my misery
            <br> Make it my bitch; can't be everyone's favorite girl
            <br> So take aim and fire away
            <br> I've never been so wide awake
            <br> No, nobody but me can keep me safe
            <br> And I'm on my way
            <br> The blood moon is on the rise
            <br> The fire burning in my eyes
            <br> No, nobody but me can keep me safe
            <br> And I'm on my way
            <br> Lo siento mucho (Farru), pero me voy (Eh)
            <br> Porque a tu lado me di cuenta que nada soy (Eh-ey)
            <br> Y me cansé de luchar y de guerrear en vano
            <br> De estar en la línea de fuego y de meter la mano
            <br> Acepto mis errore', también soy humano
            <br> Y tú no ve' que lo hago porque te amo (Pum-pum-pum-pum)
            <br> Pero ya (Ya) no tengo más na' que hacer aquí (Aquí)
            <br> Me voy, llegó la hora 'e partir (Partir)
            <br> De mi propio camino, seguir lejos de ti
            <br> So take aim and fire away
            <br> I've never been so wide awake
            <br> No, nobody but me can keep me safe
            <br> And I'm on my way
            <br> The blood moon is on the rise (Is on the rise, na-na)
            <br> The fire burning in my eyes (The fire burning in my eyes)
            <br> No, nobody but me can keep me safe
            <br> And I'm on my way
            <br> I'm on my way
            <br> Everybody keep me safe
            <br> Everybody keep me safe
            <br> Everybody keep me safe
            <br> Everybody, everybody on my way
            <br> So take aim and fire away
            <br> I've never been so wide awake
            <br> No, nobody but me can keep me safe
            <br> And I'm on my way
            <br> The blood moon is on the rise
            <br> The fire burning in my eyes

        <h1> Lyrics of Heading Home </h1>

        <p> I was so insatiable
            <br> 'Til the lights came on
            <br> And the stories got old
            <br> Now there's no one here I know
            <br> And the city outside's
            <br> Not the same anymore
            <br> And I
            <br> I remember when we were young
            <br> We'd write our names in the sand, so carelessly
            <br> Then the rain came and yours was gone
            <br> And now mine, it stands alone
            <br> Nobody sees me
            <br> Now I'm a one man show
            <br> I'll do this on my own
            <br> We knew it all then
            <br> Now this is all I know
            <br> Guess I'm heading home now
            <br> Ooh-ooh (Yeah), ooh-ooh
            <br> Ooh-ooh, guess I'm heading home now
            <br> Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
            <br> Ooh-ooh, guess I'm heading home now
            <br> And the music always played
            <br> With the sound of our lives
            <br> And the sweetest escape
            <br> And the neighbours would complain
            <br> We would turn it up louder
            <br> Who cares anyway?
            <br> 'Cause we-
            <br> We remember that we were young
            <br> Our lives were grains in the sand
            <br> Had we made our castles and kingdoms up?
            <br> Now the waves have torn them down
            <br> Nobody sees me
            <br> Now I'm a one man show
            <br> Ooh-ooh (Yeah), ooh-ooh
            <br> Ooh-ooh, guess I'm heading home now
            <br> Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
            <br> Ooh-ooh, guess I'm heading home now
            <br> You'll find me
            <br> I'll be here, oh
            <br> I can't see
            <br> I can't breathe anymore
            <br> But how could we have stayed?
            <br> You were high on love
            <br> I was drunk
            <br> Drunk on the pain
            <br> Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh (Ooh)
            <br> Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh (Guess I'm heading, I'm heading, I'm heading)
            <br> I'm heading home
            <br> Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh (Mmh-hm)
            <br> Ooh-ooh
            <br> Guess, I'm heading home now

        <h1> Lyrics of Alone Part 1 </h1>

        <p> Lost in your mind
            <br> I wanna know
            <br> Am I losing my mind?
            <br> Never let me go
            <br> If this night is not forever
            <br> At least we are together
            <br> I know I'm not alone
            <br> I know I'm not alone
            <br> Anywhere, whenever
            <br> Apart, but still together
            <br> I know I'm not alone
            <br> I know I'm not alone
            <br> I know I'm not alone
            <br> I know I'm not alone
            <br> Un-conscious mind
            <br> I'm wide awake
            <br> Wanna feel one last time
            <br> Take my pain away
            <br> If this night is not forever
            <br> At least we are together
            <br> I know I'm not alone
            <br> I know I'm not alone
            <br> Anywhere, whenever
            <br> Apart, but still together
            <br> I know I'm not alone
            <br> I know I'm not alone
            <br> I know I'm not alone
            <br> I know I'm not alone

        <h1> Lyrics of Alone Part 2 </h1>

        <p> We were young, posters on the wall
            <br> Praying we're the ones that the teacher wouldn't call
            <br> We would stare at each other
            <br> 'Cause we were always in trouble
            <br> And all the cool kids did their own thing
            <br> I was on the outside, always looking in
            <br> Yeah, I was there but I wasn't
            <br> They never really cared if I was in
            <br> We all need that someone
            <br> Who gets you like no one else
            <br> Right when you need it the most
            <br> We all need a soul to rely on
            <br> A shoulder to cry on
            <br> A friend through the highs and the lows
            <br> I'm not gonna make it alone
            <br> La-la-la-la-la la
            <br> La-la-la-la-la 'lone
            <br> I'm not gonna make it alone
            <br> La-la-la-la-la la
            <br> La-la-la-la-la 'lone
            <br> Then I saw your face, your forgiving eyes
            <br> Looking back at me from the other side
            <br> Like you understood me
            <br> And I'm never letting you go, oh
            <br> We all need that someone
            <br> Who gets you like no one else
            <br> Right when you need it the most
            <br> We all need a soul to rely on
            <br> A shoulder to cry on

        <p> Hello, hello

            <br> As I scream your name?
            <br> Hello, hello

            <br> To find what I've become
            <br> Walk along the path unknown
            <br> We live, we love, we lie
            <br> Deep in the dark, I don't need the light
            <br> There's a ghost inside me
            <br> It all belongs to the other side
            <br> We live, we love, we lie

        <h1> Lyrics of Ignite </h1>

        <p> Fireflies, a million little pieces
            <br> Feeds the dying light, and brings me back to life
            <br> In your eyes, I see something to believe in
            <br> Your hands are like a flame, your palms' the sweetest pain
            <br> Let the darkness lead us into the light
            <br> Let our dreams get lost, feel the temperature rise
            <br> Baby, tell me one more beautiful lie
            <br> One touch and I ignite
            <br> Like a starship speeding into the night
            <br> You and I get lost in the infinite lights
            <br> Baby, tell me one more beautiful lie
            <br> One touch and I ignite
            <br> One touch and I ignite
            <br> One touch and I ignite
            <br> So alive, your touch is like the daylight
            <br> Burning on my skin, it turns me on again
            <br> You and I, survivors of the same kind
            <br> But we're the only ones dancing on the sun
            <br> Let the darkness lead us into the light
            <br> Let our dreams get lost, feel the temperature rise
            <br> Baby, tell me one more beautiful lie
            <br> One touch and I ignite
            <br> Like a starship speeding into the night
            <br> You and I get lost in the infinite lights
            <br> Baby, tell me one more beautiful lie
            <br> One touch and I ignite
            <br> One touch and I ignite
            <br> One touch and I ignite
            <br> Diamonds are forever, but all we need is just tonight
            <br> We're monumental tremors that can freeze the speed of life
            <br> Just like particles that's falling from heaven all over the stars
            <br> Hear you calling for me, hear you calling me home from afar
            <br> Let the darkness lead us into the light
            <br> Let our dreams get lost, feel the temperature rise
            <br> Baby, tell me one more beautiful lie
            <br> One touch and I ignite
            <br> I feel the heat as we collide
            <br> Like a fever that feels so right
            <br> So baby, tell me one more beautiful lie
            <br> One touch and I ignite
            <br> One touch and I ignite
            <br> One touch and I ignite
            <br> One touch and I ignite
            <br> One touch and I ignite

        <h1> Lyrics of Sing Me to Sleep </h1>

        <p> Wait a second, let me catch my breath
            <br> Remind me how it feels to hear your voice
            <br> Your lips are movin', I can't hear a thing
            <br> Livin' life as if we had a choice
            <br> Anywhere, anytime
            <br> I would do anything for you
            <br> Anything for you
            <br> Yesterday got away
            <br> Melodies stuck inside your head
            <br> A song in every breath
            <br> Sing me to sleep now
            <br> Sing me to sleep
            <br> Won't you sing me to sleep now?
            <br> Sing me to sleep
            <br> Remember me now, time cannot erase
            <br> I can hear your whispers in my mind
            <br> I've become what you cannot embrace
            <br> Our memory will be my lullaby
            <br> Sing me to sleep now
            <br> Sing me to sleep
            <br> Won't you sing me to sleep now?
            <br> Sing me to sleep
            <br> A-anytime
            <br> I would do
            <br> Time away
